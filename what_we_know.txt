The message has length 1902341

The message is divided into 7 bits, each of a height 757 and a width of 359.
-Both 757 and 359 are prime.  These are both included in the list of primes in Bit 2.
--757 is the 133rd prime, 359 is the 72nd prime.

Bit 1: A "vertical line".  Nothing else, possibly to set the height standard.

No dividing line

Bit 2: A list of numbers 1 to 756, one line each.

No dividing line

Bit 3: A list of primes, from the first (2) to the 756th.

Bit 4: A sin curve
-We figure this represents the wave that the message was sent in.  We compare this to Bit 5 to approximate the size of the alien.

Bit 5: An image of an alien

Bit 6: An image of spaceships/satellites

Bit 7: An image of an alien sideways next to a planet, followed by other planets

There are spaces in-between bits, each with a binary sequence.  We are in the process of interpreting those now.
-Converted to decimal, as well as reversed and converted (matching the numbering system from Bit 2).
